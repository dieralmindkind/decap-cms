# How to Reset Epson Printers Using Resetter Software
 
If you have an Epson printer that is showing errors such as "Service required" or "Ink pad is at the end of its service life", you may need to reset it using a resetter software. A resetter software is a tool that can reset the internal counters of your printer and restore its functionality. In this article, we will show you how to download and use a resetter software for Epson printers.
 
## Step 1: Download the Resetter Software
 
The first step is to download the resetter software for your specific Epson printer model. You can find the resetter software for various Epson printers on websites such as [www.resetepson.org](https://www.resetepson.org) or [www.waredata.com](https://www.waredata.com). The resetter software usually comes in a zip file format, so you will need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. After extracting the zip file, you will see a folder with the name of your printer model and an executable file with the name "AdjProg.exe" or something similar.

## Step 2: Run the Resetter Software
 
The next step is to run the resetter software as an administrator. To do this, right-click on the executable file and select "Run as administrator". You may see a warning message from your antivirus program or Windows Defender, but you can ignore it and allow the program to run. The resetter software will open a window with some options and buttons. You may need to enter a password to access the program. The default password is usually "12345" or "123456". You can also find the password on the website where you downloaded the zip file.
 
## Step 3: Select Your Printer Model and Port
 
The third step is to select your printer model and port from the drop-down menus on the top of the window. Make sure you choose the correct model and port that matches your printer. You can check your printer port by going to Control Panel > Devices and Printers > Right-click on your printer > Properties > Ports. After selecting your printer model and port, click on "OK".
 
## Step 4: Choose the Adjustment Mode
 
The fourth step is to choose the adjustment mode that you want to perform on your printer. To do this, click on "Particular adjustment mode" on the main window. You will see a list of options such as "Waste ink pad counter", "Head cleaning", "EEPROM data copy", etc. Depending on your printer problem, you may need to choose different options. For example, if you want to reset the waste ink pad counter, which is one of the most common errors in Epson printers, you need to select "Waste ink pad counter" and click on "OK".
